# Geno2Pheno - Introduction

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that maps genotype to phenotype using gene expression values. By leveraging the power of deep learning and gene expression data, we seek to uncover the underlying relationship between genetic variations and observed phenotypic outcomes.

# Dataset
The Dataset used to train this model is from 10xGenomics which consists of Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a healthy donor. <br> https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_10k_v3 <br>

Estimated Number of Cells -> **11,769** <br>
Mean Reads per Cell -> **54,286** <br>
Median Genes per Cell -> **1,906** <br>
